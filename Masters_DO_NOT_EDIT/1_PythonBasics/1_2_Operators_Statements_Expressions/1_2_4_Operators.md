Make variables to represent the length and width of a rectangle, called length and width, respectively. You should set length to 10 and width to 5.

Then, write some mathematical expressions in print statements to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

Your output should look like this:

```
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

Note that you should be printing a string and a variable on the same line each time!

**Rectangle Area Formula:**

A = L * W 

**Rectangle Perimeter Formula:**

P = 2 * (L + W)

L is the length of the rectangle, W is the width of the rectangle, A is the area of the rectangle, and P is the perimeter of the rectangle.
