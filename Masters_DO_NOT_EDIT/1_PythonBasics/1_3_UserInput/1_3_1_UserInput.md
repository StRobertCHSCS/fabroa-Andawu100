# 1_3_1_userinput.py


Your friend is about to have a birthday! Write a program that asks them how old they are. Once they enter their age, print how many candles they’ll need for their birthday cake. (This should be one more than their current age.)

You will have to use `input` to retrieve information from the user, and int to convert what they type into an integer. Finally, you’ll have to use your knowledge of variables, mathematical operators, and print to tell the user how many candles they will need.

Here is what running your program should look like:

```text
Enter your age: 117
You will need 118 candles for your birthday cake!
```
