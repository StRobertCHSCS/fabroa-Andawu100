# 1_3_2_userinput.py


Take your code from the Rectangle exercise in the last lesson, and change it so that the user gets to type the length and width of the rectangle.

As with the exercise in the last lesson, you will need two variables, one called length and one called width. In this exercise, you will need to make a call to input for each of these variables.

Then, write some mathematical expressions in print statements to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

If the user enters 10 for the length and 5 for the width, your output should look like this:

```text
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

Note that you should be printing a string and a variable on the same line each time!
