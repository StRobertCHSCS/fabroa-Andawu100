# 2_5_2_WhileLoops

The following program contains a fairly sophisticated while loop. Use a tracing table and predict what the program will print before running it!

```python
# Can you guess what this program prints?
x = 5
y = 5

while x > 5 or y < 10:
    print(x)
    print(y)
    
    x = 15 - x
    y = y + 2
```
