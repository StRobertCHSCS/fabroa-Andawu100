We have a loud talking parrot and we are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Write a program that first prompts if the parrot is talking and then gets an `hour` value from the user that is the current hour time in the range 0..23.   
Output "We're in trouble!" if we are in trouble, "Everything is fine." if we are not in trouble.

## Sample Run 1
```text
Is the parrot talking (y/n)?  y
What is the current hour? 11
Everything is fine.
```

## Sample Run 2
```text
Is the parrot talking (y/n)?  y
What is the current hour? 6
We're in trouble!
```

## Sample Run 3
```text
Is the parrot talking (y/n)?  n
What is the current hour? 21
Everything is fine.
```
