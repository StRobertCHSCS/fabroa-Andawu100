# 2_4_1_logical_operators.py


This program demonstrates the use of the different logical operators in Python. Try changing the values of x and y, and see what happens.

```python
x = True
y = False

print("x: " + str(x))
print("y: " + str(y))

print("x and y")
print(x and y)

print("x or y")
print(x or y)

print("x and not y")
print(x and not y)

# This means "It is not the case
# that x is true, and it is the
# case that y is true."
print("not x and y")
print(not x and y)

# Notice that you can use parentheses
# to force (x and y) to be evaluated
# before the "not" keyword is applied.
#
# This means "It is not the case that
# both x and y are true."
print("not (x and y)")
print(not (x and y))

```
