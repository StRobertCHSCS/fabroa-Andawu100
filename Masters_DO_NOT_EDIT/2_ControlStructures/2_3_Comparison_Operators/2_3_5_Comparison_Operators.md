# 2_3_5_Comparison_operator.py

Write a program that reports whether or not someone is old enough to vote in the U.S. You should do the following in your program:

* Ask the user for their age, and store it in a variable
* Use an if-else statement with the proper comparison operator to print `You are old enough to vote!` if the person’s age is at least 18, and `You are not old enough to vote.` otherwise


An example run of your program might look like this:
```text
Age: 19
You are old enough to vote!
```

… or like this:

```text
Age: 16
You are not old enough to vote.
```
