# 2_3_6_Comparison_Operators.py

Write a program that asks the user for their name using `input`. It should have another string variable that represents the name on a particular table reservation in a restaurant. The program should print `Right this way!` if the user’s name matches the name on the reservation, and `Sorry, we don't have a reservation under that name.` otherwise.


An example run of your program might look like this:
```text
Name: Shonda
Right this way!
```

… or like this:
```text
Name: Mel
Sorry, we don't have a reservation under that name.
```
