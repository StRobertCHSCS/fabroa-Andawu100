# 2_2_1_if_statements.py

This program has a few problems with it. 
* Fix it so that it prints `I can juggle!` if the variable is `True`, and `I can't juggle.` if the variable is `False`.
* Draw a flow chart for the fixed code

```
can_juggle = True

# The code below has problems. See if
# you can fix them!
if can_juggle print "I can juggle!"
else
print "I can't juggle."
```
