Write a program to help you take care of your plants!

Make a boolean variable called `needs_water` that represents whether or not one of your plants needs water.

Make another boolean variable called `needs_to_be_repotted` that represents whether or not you need to repot one of your plants.

Print the value of each of these variables.

Your output should look like this:

```text
Needs water: True
Needs to be repotted: False
