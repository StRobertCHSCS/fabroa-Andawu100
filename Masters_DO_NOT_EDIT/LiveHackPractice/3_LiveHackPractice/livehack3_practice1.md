The mega Canadian clothing store chain, Forever Fab, has noticed an increase in the number 
of American customers over the past year due to the widening difference between the Canadian 
and U.S dollars.  Forever Fab lists its prices in Canadian dollars and American customers 
frequently complain about the "high prices", not realizing that with the currency exchange, 
they are getting a discount.   The store has taken the initiative to educate its American 
customers by displaying currency conversion tables throughout their stores.

Create an program that takes in the Canadian to U.S dollar exchange rate, starting price, and ending price, and then outputs a conversion table of Canadian to U.S Dollars with increments of $10

```text
Enter the Canadian to US Dollar exhange rate: 0.75
Enter the starting value: 10
Enter the end value: 200

Can Price  --> US Price
10 --> 7.5
20 --> 15
30 --> 22.5
...
200 --> 150.0
