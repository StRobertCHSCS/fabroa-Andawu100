You have been working really hard at school and you're thinking about taking a summer vacation. You've discussed your thoughts with your parents and they told you that you can go away to Europe if you achieve an average 80% or greater and earn $500 before the summer.  If you do not earn $500 but still achieve an average 80% or over, you can go to California.  If you cannot achieve at least 80%, you don't get to go away.

1. Create a Flowchart for the above scenario.  Inputs should be your `mark` and `earnings before the summer`.  Be sure that it is labelled appropriately and uses the proper shapes.

2. Write the python code for a program based on the above scenario.  Include the proper output statements that indicate what you will be doing this summer
