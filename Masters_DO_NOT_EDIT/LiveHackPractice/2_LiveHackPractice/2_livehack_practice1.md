A right-angled triangle has the property that when the values of the lengths of the sides are squared, the sum of the two smaller values is equal to the larger value. For example, 12, 5, and 13 make a right-angled triangle, because 12 * 12 = 144, 5 * 5 = 25, 13 * 13 = 169, and 144 + 25 = 169.

Write a program that asks the user to enter three values and then determines whether the triangle created is a right-angled triangle or not.  Do not assume that the sides are entered in order of smallest to greatest.  (i.e you donâ€™t prompt them to enter the hypotenuse).


1. Create a flowchart of a solution to the problem.

2. Create the program in Pycharm
